From the above:

**First Dart:** Per an expression from Buddha, “the inescapable physical or mental discomfort is the “first dart” of existence.”

**Second Dart(s):** Our reactions to first darts. These are the darts we tend to throw ourselves. Most of our suffering comes from second darts.

This quote sums it up nicely…..
