# 0. The core claim
> ==In any moment, you have access to all the information you need in order to make "the next right action"==

- Things (actions, thoughts, ideas) can feel one of two ways:
	1. Obvious, straightforward, transparently correct ([[Consonance (AKA consensus)]])
	2. Grind-y, off, bad ([[Dissonance]])

- If something feels transparently correct (that is, if there is consensus), go ahead and do it, until a feeling of off-ness appears, at which point, pause and reassess
- If something feels grind-y and off, then it's not the right thing to do - pause and reassess
- This is uhh, kind of the whole thing?

- Make decisions where:
	1. You know you're making the right decision in that moment
	2. You're doing what feels best
- AKA, be in a [[Flow state]], more and more reliably
# 1. You have access to all the data you need always
- [[Layer 1 (perceptions, ultimate reality)]]
# 2. But we habitually distrust layer 1
- People are accustomed to making themselves do things that feel grind-y and off
- People think they *have* to do things that are grind-y and off. "If I only do things that feel good, then won't I just like, play video-games all the time?"
- That is, people are used to distrusting and disregarding [[Layer 1 (perceptions, ultimate reality)]], and instead following their thoughts and abstractions from [[Layer 2 (imaginations)]]
	- [[Distrusting our sense data]]
## Core false beliefs
- [[The core false belief → "Something I'm feeling is bad to feel"]]
- And then as a result, "[[I don't know what to do]]"
# 3. What goes wrong when you distrust your sense data
- You create suffering, basically!
	- [[Second Dart feelings]]
- So, you think you need to reply to an email right now
- However, it feels bad to do; there's resistance in your body, a feeling of grind-y off-ness
- You fight yourself, you feel tense and unhappy, you feel like you're at war with yourself
- Eventually you maybe force yourself to write the email, or maybe you procrastinate for another few days
- Stuckness
	- [[I don't know what to do]]
	- [[Confusion and feeling bad]]
	- [[Getting stuck]]
	- [[Tension and avoidance]]
# 4. Alternative approach
- When you recognise that:
	- [[All feelings are good]]
	- [[Feelings are signal]]
	- [[Feelings don't contain false info]]
	- [[One unitary preference (no parts)]]
- Notice "huh, the idea of replying to my emails right now feels bad"
- "I guess it's not time to reply to my emails"
- "Let me just pause and see if anything else feels good to do"
- Then, maybe remaining paused for a while feels good, just resting and doing nothing. And then maybe you have a genuine desire to go make a cup of coffee, or to go outside, or maybe the pause gives you enough time to realise that answering the email wouldn't be so bad, etc
- [[You will always have the info to make the next best action]]
## [[Flow state]]
- The idea, really, is to be in a flow state where you honour your experience
- If something feels bad, that's perfect unfakeable signal that that thing is indeed bad to do right now, and there's no need to force yourself to do it
- It something feels transparently correct, then that's perfect unfakeable signal that that thing is the correct thing to engage with right now
# 5. This is a much nicer way to live
- [[Happiness and productivity]]
# 6. Common pushbacks
- [[What if what I want to do is be lazy?]]
- [[What if it starts to feel bad?]]
- [[What about unknown unknowns?]]
