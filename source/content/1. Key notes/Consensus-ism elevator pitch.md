- The core claim:
> In any moment, you have access to all the information you need in order to make "the next right action"
- Things can feel one of two ways:
	1. Obvious, straightforward, transparently correct
	2. Grind-y, off, bad
- If something feels transparently correct, go ahead and do it, until a feeling of off-ness appears, at which point, pause and reassess
- If something feels grind-y and off, then it's not the right thing to do - pause and reassess
- This is uhh, kind of the whole thing?
# So like, what's the problem?
- People are accustomed to making themselves do things that feel grind-y and off
- People think they *have* to do things that are grind-y and off. "If I only do things that feel good, then won't I just like, play video-games all the time?"
## Distrusting your sense data
- There's a really great David Chapman clip here about how the West (in particular, Western philosophy, with Decartes as the prime example) *begins* from a place of distrust of our sense data, and how paranoid and weird this is
	- E.g., "I think, therefore I am", where Decartes decided that we can't trust our sense data because a demon might be making us hallucinate that we are e.g. in this room, and the only thing we can trust is our thoughts
- However, Chapman points out that this is *really weird*, because our sense data is pretty much always very trustworthy, and it's our thoughts that mislead us like, all the frickin time. We don't have control over which thoughts appear (try meditating for 10 minutes and report back), so Decartes could have easily instead said that an evil demon gives us intrusive and pointless thoughts, and it's our sense data which is rock-solid and congruent
- So anyway, by default we're used to distrusting the signal in our body that says "I don't want to do this!", and instead power through and force ourself to do a thing
- There's a background belief that emotions are just random things to be ignored, basically. That they don't contain much signal.
	- Vs e.g. in people who no longer have the emotional part of their brain, they can no longer make rational decisions, and essentially blow up their lives (e.g. see the book ["Decartes' Error"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_Error))
# What goes wrong when you distrust your sense data
- So, you think you need to reply to an email right now
- However, it feels bad to do; there's resistance in your body, a feeling of grind-y off-ness
- You fight yourself, you feel sense and unhappy, you feel like you're at war with yourself
- Eventually you maybe force yourself to write the email, or maybe you procrastinate for another few days
## Alternative approach
- Notice "huh, the idea of replying to my emails right now feels bad"
- "I guess it's not time to reply to my emails"
- "Let me just pause and see if anything else feels good to do"
- Then, maybe remaining paused for a while feels good, just resting and doing nothing. And then maybe you have a genuine desire to go make a cup of coffee, or to go outside, or maybe the pause gives you enough time to realise that answering the email wouldn't be so bad, etc
## Flow state
- The idea, really, is to be in a flow state where you honour your experience
- If something feels bad, that's perfect unfakeable signal that that thing is indeed bad to do right now, and there's no need to force yourself to do it
- It something feels transparently correct, then that's perfect unfakeable signal that that thing is the correct thing to engage with right now
# "Won't it just make me play video games all the time?"
- "If I just do what I want all the time, won't it just make me lazy, make me play video games all the time, for example?"
- Well, if it feels genuinely good to play video games, then go ahead. But I'm sure that after an hour or 5, it will start to feel bad, at which point you'll notice this, and you can pause, and see what you'd rather do
- There's no risk of getting stuck - you will always have access to this sense-data of "transparently good/correct vs grind-y and bad"
- This was a key insight for me - you will *always* have access to this, and it's all you need to make the next best choice
