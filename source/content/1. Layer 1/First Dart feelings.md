- See [[First Dart vs Second Dart]]

- There are two types
	1. Emotions
	2. Consensus vs dissonance

# 1. Emotions
- First dart emotions are good, useful signal
- E.g., the feeling of sadness in your system provides a lot of useful signal. You're currently feeling sad! Perhaps you'd like to investigate why! Etc
- And, as per [[Decartes' Error]], if you didn't have emotions, you'd no longer be able to make good decisions. They are in fact essential
# 2. Consensus vs dissonance
- *I may also call like consonance vs dissonance as these make more sense as a pair. But consonance-ism is even more of a bloody mouthful than consensus-ism*

## Consensus
- [[Consonance (AKA consensus)]]

## Dissonance
- [[Dissonance]]
