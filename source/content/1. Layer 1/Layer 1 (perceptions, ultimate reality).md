> There’s a fascinating monotony to the world’s mystical traditions. Everyone sees the same thing if they squint at their consciousness long enough.
> “Many paths lead from the foot of the mountain, but at the peak we all gaze at the single bright moon.”
> Also everyone loves this. It’s everyone’s favorite. To everyone this feels really good, nice, like a vacation from a lot of your worries, an invitation to be compassionate to others, appreciate both sameness and difference, and other good stuff, bliss, a lot of feelings people try to obtain at great expense through other means—gustatory, pharmacological, commercial, and so on.

# Experiencing pure layer 1 → deep okayness
- Alex's substack → "[Consensus-ism part 2 (Something like Deep Okayness has happened to me and I like it)](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/consensus-ism-part-2)". It's a good post sir
# It's subtractive, not additive
- Having an experience where you drop layer 2 entirely, and you're like "woah, wtf, I didn't need it?"

> Similarly, you’d heard about mystical experiences for a long time, things about oneness or a Supreme Reality or similar, and they seemed analogous to some stuff you’d been through. Then, you touch the State, and you go like, what the fuck, this has always been here, _this whole time?_
> It feels like you have been given a glimpse of a greater reality. But what does that reality have to teach you? Unless you become extremely fond of one or another mystical tradition’s beliefs, it’s hard to say. Perhaps what you have glimpsed is simply a barer sensate consciousness, freed of some of the interpretive processing that makes normal thinky consciousness stressful. Perhaps what you have glimpsed is the thing people call God, and now you know that this thing is the foundation of everything you are, with a few layers of costume on top. In the end, you really want to interpret it definitively, but it evades interpretation. You are comforted by the memory of the State, but, in the end, puzzled, too. Maybe you feel Better deep down, in a way that’s hard to define, but sometimes, months later, you doubt whether this is still true.
