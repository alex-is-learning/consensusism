- Kinda the same as extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation?
- Kinda the same as self-coercion vs non-coercion?
# Intrinsic motivation
- From the book "The Listening Society: A Metamodern Guide to Politics, Book One, Hanzi Freinacht"

>“Somewhat strange bed-fellows, these three, hackers, hipsters and hippies. What, then, unites the triple-H population? One thing is that all three groups share an alternative relationship to work and the market: They are all driven by what psychologists of work call intrinsic motivation and self-realization, rather than extrinsic motivation, such as monetary rewards, consumption and security. This means that they work by another social and economic logic than any of the old groups in industrial society”
