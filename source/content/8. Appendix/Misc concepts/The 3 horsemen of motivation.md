- You know what it's like to have a real need vs a fake one:

1. Real, clear need (overflowing bathtub)
2. Something you want to do with no conflict
3. Everything else is a fake need

- Overflowing bathtub, genuine desire, and fake desire
- Consensus, consensus, no consensus
## Real urgent need
Real urgent need **(Horseman of the overflowing bathtub)**:
	- Fire break out whilst cooking in kitchen
	- Bathtub is overflowing
	- Needing to go to bathroom right now, etc 
	- Once they can map that - if you know that something is actually necessary, it feels like that urgent thing 
## Real desire
**Horseman of pure enjoyment**:
- And then there's still that you totally like to do, no conflict, just do 
	- If you'd like to do it, then it feels like that
## Everything else
**Horseman of everything else**:
- Everything else is fake need
- Some habit of telling yourself that it's necessary, while not believing it

# Spotting fake beliefs parading as real beliefs
- Name objects in front of you, notice it's effortless, easy, 
- Then say something like "my dog speaks spanish", "I find chocolate disgusting"
- When it runs into that "ehhh" feeling - your words are contradicting what you know to be true 

**True belief:**
- Not like it's an oracle for what's actually true, it's a marker for belief. 
- Like can say the milk is in the fridge, realise it's not, but you believed it when you said it 
- Feel like need to convince people of christianity, vs like if you were there and saw Jesus raise from the dead and it's not a big deal
	- If it feels self-evident...

**Point out fake beliefs:**
- So with that in mind, "this thing that you're saying you need to do, clearly you don't"
- Then they argue it
- Then you point to where they're contradicting themselves
- Until they're like "oh, well shit yeah"
- Crack them open, notice that they're deceiving themselves 
- Then point out that it's endemic, all through system
