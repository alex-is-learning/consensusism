- There's a really great David Chapman clip ([here]([https://x.com/Meaningness/status/1886512455289069669/video/1](https://x.com/Meaningness/status/1886512455289069669/video/1 "https://x.com/Meaningness/status/1886512455289069669/video/1"))) about how the West (in particular, Western philosophy, with Decartes as the prime example) *begins* from a place of distrust of our sense data, and how paranoid and weird this is
	- *E.g., "I think, therefore I am", where Decartes decided that we can't trust our sense data because a demon might be making us hallucinate that we are e.g. in this room, and the only thing we can trust is our thoughts*
- However, Chapman points out that this is *really weird*, because our sense data is pretty much always very trustworthy, and it's our thoughts that mislead us like, all the frickin time. We don't have control over which thoughts appear (try meditating for 10 minutes and report back), so Decartes could have easily instead said that an evil demon gives us intrusive and pointless thoughts, and it's our sense data which is rock-solid and congruent
- So anyway, by default we're used to distrusting the signal in our body that says "I don't want to do this!", and instead power through and force ourself to do a thing
- There's a background belief that emotions are just random things to be ignored, basically. That they don't contain much signal.
	- Vs e.g. in people who no longer have the emotional part of their brain, they can no longer make rational decisions, and essentially blow up their lives (e.g. see the book ["Decartes' Error"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_Error))

# Why we distrust our emotions 
- I think the exhortations from e.g. the Ancient Greeks, the Stoics re: "don't let your emotions control you" are totally valid, because they'll be talking about what are essentially emotional spirals, when an emotion has grown and is now this big uncontrollable mess, like when e.g. you've brooded on a resentment which has grown wilder the more you've brooded
- So yes, seriously, don't choose your actions based on these emotion spirals - the size of the spiral is way bigger than the actual trigger
- This is exactly First Darts vs [[Second Darts]] btw. First darts are small, real, valid, second darts are our reactions to the first darts, and they're overblown. "Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional"
### We've thrown the baby out with the bathwater
- Because huge emotion spirals have gotten us into trouble, we decide that emotions *in general* can't be trusted
- But actually, the "first dart" emotions are useful signal (otherwise why would we have them at all?)
	- (And, if you take someone who doesn't have access to this signal, they become incredibly irrational and incapable of making good decisions → see the book )
