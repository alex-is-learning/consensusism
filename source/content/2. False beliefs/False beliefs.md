# 1. The core false belief → "Something I'm feeling is bad to feel"
- It’s “something I’m feeling/experiencing is bad to feel/experience” - as if there’s a you separate from the experience
- It could be argued as being the same as a lack of secure attachment. "Ahh, this is bad, must push it away", rather than feeling okay with what arises
- "I am bad because I feel xyz"
	- Inner critic, negative inner voice, self-punishing dialogue

- Very similar, if not the same → "⁠There’s something wrong (with this moment, with me)_"
- Aversion, second dart, ego-type stuff

## Downstream of the core false belief
### 1a. "I must disown some feelings, not look at them, push them away"
- ![[sasha steelman.png]]
### 1b. "I don't know what to do"
- I get used to averting my gave from looking inwards, because there's stuff that I don't want to feel
- I get used to being somewhat dissociated, basically
- I can’t find out the answers by introspecting, I need to look Out There

# 2. It's normal to push through resistance
- If I have resistance to something, it can make sense to push through and do it anyway
- Resistance and badness is fine, and I can power through
# 3. I can't rely on my feelings
- I can't trust my feelings/cues (impulsive/can't be trusted/is selfish)
