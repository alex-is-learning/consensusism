- The ultimate false belief is "something I'm feeling/experiencing is bad to feel/experience"
- The truth is that all feelings are good
	- There isn't a separate "you" that the feeling/experience is *happening to*, there's just experience
	- You can’t be something different from your experience
	- So there’s no Managing Things that’s possible
