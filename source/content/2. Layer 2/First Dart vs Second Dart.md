- Corresponds exactly to "[[Layer 1 (perceptions, ultimate reality)]]" vs "[[Layer 2 (imaginations)]]"


- "First Dart" vs "Second Dart" are terms from Buddhism that I first learned about from this post that [[Michael Stroe]] sent me:
	- [First and Second Darts: The darts we throw ourselves](https://www.tjwaldorf.com/first-and-second-darts-the-darts-we-throw-ourselves/), blog post by TJ Waldorf

From the above:

**First Dart:** Per an expression from Buddha, “the inescapable physical or mental discomfort is the “first dart” of existence.”

**Second Dart(s):** Our reactions to first darts. These are the darts we tend to throw ourselves. Most of our suffering comes from second darts.

This quote sums it up nicely…..

- Basically, 1st darts are the things that appear in layer 1 of experience → they are perceptions. You just stubbed your toe → there's a feeling of pain in your toe. A fully enlightened person would also feel this pain
- 2nd dart = the reaction to the first dart. You stubbed your toe, and then get really pissed off thinking about how bad things always happen to you. Etc


- In the seen, simply the seen
