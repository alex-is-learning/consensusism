- We’re going to try to teach a skill
- Strongly recommend you take this not as “I need to read this and get all the information”, but as a toolkit for potential resources you may need. If you have some brilliant insight from reading this, drop this book immediately and go and do the things
- It’s not that you need to thoroughly understand everything in order to do it; any tool in here could be the tool that you need. Not a book to read in order. It’s written down in the order that we think is mostly likely people would go through it, but no one is 100% going to be the average
- Use your own common sense and guidance. Nothing here is going to substitute for a working knowledge of how to interact with people and the world. Caveat: emptor is in full effect
