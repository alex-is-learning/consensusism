- Prompt:
	- I haven't read the book Decartes' Error yet, but I'm curious about how we got to a place where the emotions were considered... secondary to reason, perhaps even as distractions, by the culture. Like, rationalists often think that they can just reason, and emotions are a distraction. Is there a history of how we've interfaced with our emotions? I'm thinking e.g. of something like how Heidegger wrote a history of what it is like to be human. I'm wondering if e.g. the ancient greeks thought x, then maybe e.g. the industrial revolution made us too busy to think about our emotions. And how peasants didn't have time etc. and now there's a post like "[Generalised Hangriness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/naAeSkQur8ueCAAfY/generalized-hangriness-a-standard-rationalist-stance-toward)" which a friend has said is a watershed moments re: rationalists taking emotions seriously


Right, you’re trying to get at _the historical arc of “reason is primary; emotion is suspect”_ and how we ended up with rationalist subcultures needing posts like _Generalized Hangriness_ to rediscover “emotions are information.” The _core story_ here is **not** that humans used to be emotional and then moderns became rational. It’s that **Western philosophy inherited a very specific split**, and then several later cultural movements **amplified** it for different reasons.

  

Let me walk you through a clean narrative from ancient Greece to LessWrong.

---

## **1)** 

## **Ancient Greece:**

##  **Emotions as Wild Horses**

  

Plato and Aristotle did **not** believe that reason _should_ ignore emotion. Instead:

- **Plato:** reason is the charioteer, passions are horses.
    
    The horses aren’t _bad_ — they’re **powerful** — but require guiding.
    
- **Aristotle:** emotions can be _virtuous_ if expressed in the right amount (the “golden mean”).
    
    Anger is _good_ when it’s the right amount, for the right reasons.
    

  

So early philosophy wasn’t anti-emotion; it was **emotion-as-something-to-prune-and-tune**.

---

## **2)** 

## **Stoicism:**

##  **“Don’t let emotion control you”**

  

Popular among educated elites (especially Roman aristocrats who needed to stay composed while in power).

  

This creates:

- An ideal of **self-command**
    
- Not _no emotions_, but **no emotional reactivity**
    

  

_Stoicism is the first major cultural template for “the good person has interior calm.”_

---

## **3)** 

## **Christianity:**

##  **Emotions become** 

## **morally suspect**

  

Over ~1000 years, theology reframes emotions as:

- **desires = temptations**
    
- **bodily appetite = threat to salvation**
    
- “Virtue” = self-denial
    

  

This installs the cultural background assumption:

  

> The body leads you astray; reason and willpower bring you toward the good.

  

This is where shame toward emotions begins to get baked into Western subjectivity.

---

## **4)** 

## **Descartes:**

##  **Mind and body get** 

## **officially divorced**

  

René Descartes (17th c.) says:

  

> The mind is a thinking thing; the body is just a machine.

  

This is the **mind-body dualism** modern Westerners unconsciously inherit.

  

Damásio calls this the **“error”** in _Descartes’ Error_:

  

> _Rationality_ **_requires_** _emotional input._

> Feelings guide practical decision-making.

> Without emotion, the brain cannot choose.

  

This is the exact pivot point where:

- **Emotion** becomes animal / base / unreliable
    
- **Reason** becomes divine / human / correct
    

  

You can feel rationalist culture echoing this _verbatim_.

---

## **5)** 

## **Industrial Revolution + Victorian culture:**

##  **Self-control becomes a** 

## **class marker**

  

As capitalism accelerates, the ideal urban worker/citizen becomes:

- punctual
    
- disciplined
    
- self-regulating
    

  

Emotional expression gets associated with:

- women
    
- children
    
- the poor
    
- “the primitive”
    
- colonized peoples
    

  

Emotion is now **not just irrational, but low status.**

  

This sticks _hard_.

---

## **6)** 

## **20th century psychology splits in two**

|**Tradition**|**View of Emotions**|
|---|---|
|**Freud** (Europe)|Emotions = subconscious forces that must be interpreted|
|**Behaviorism** (US)**|Emotions = noise; ignore the interior, measure only behavior|

So in America especially, **feelings become scientifically illegitimate** for about 60 years.

---

## **7)** 

## **The Counter-Move:**

##  **Neuroscience, somatic psychology, trauma research**

  

Starting ~1970s onward:

- attachment theory
    
- trauma research
    
- affective neuroscience
    
- somatic therapies (Gendlin, Focusing; later IFS)
    

  

These fields collectively argue:

  

> Emotions are **not problems**; they are **data** about needs.

  

But academic psychology is slow to update culture.

---

## **8)** 

## **Rationalists rediscover the body**

  

Now we arrive at **your actual question**.

  

Rationalists tend to inherit:

- Stoic ideal of composure
    
- Cartesian mind/body split
    
- Behaviorist suspicion of interior experience
    
- Victorian class-coded emotional restraint
    
- Computer metaphor for cognition (“the brain is a CPU”)
    

  

So historically, rationalists think:

  

> Emotion = _bias_, contamination of reasoning.

  

But then reality forces the update:

- burnout
    
- overwhelmedness
    
- social problems
    
- relationship problems
    
- decision paralysis
    

  

So: the culture begins to update from the inside.

  

This is where **Generalized Hangriness** enters:

  

> Emotions _make claims_ that may be wrong,

> but the _signal behind them_ is important.

  

This is exactly Damásio’s point framed for rationalists.

  

Emotion ≠ enemy of reason.

Emotion = _input channel_ for **values, needs, and salience**.

## **9)** 

## **Where this leaves us**

  

We are currently living through a **re-integration moment**:

- From **“emotion is irrational”**
    
    → to **“emotion is evidence about needs and internal state.”**
    

  

Rationalists didn’t _discover_ this; they are catching up to:

- affective neuroscience
    
- trauma-aware psychology
    
- somatic practices
    
- pre-modern philosophies of virtue
    

  

But they are doing it in their own language:

- “hangriness”
    
- “somatic markers”
    
- “predictive processing”
    
- “parts / subagents models”
    
- “emotions make claims”
    

  

Your sense that this is a **watershed moment** is correct.

## **If you want, I can now do one of the following:**

1. **Make a visual timeline** (ancient Greece → rationalism → trauma science)
    
2. **Summarize Descartes’ Error in 10 key insights**
    
3. **Write a model of emotion that rationalists find intuitive**
    
4. **Map this to your personal developmental history**
    
5. **Generate an Anki deck** for this conceptual arc
    

  

Which one should we do?
