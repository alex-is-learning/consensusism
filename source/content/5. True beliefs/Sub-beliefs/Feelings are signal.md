- Feelings are indicator lights of "X is going well/badly"

## Sasha Chapin: "[Acting like emotions don't exist is a poor strategy](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/acting-like-emotions-dont-exist-is)"

> It’s amazing how often emotions are neglected in writing about work in general. Think of productivity books that don’t talk about the emotional roots of procrastination, or books on entrepreneurship that don’t talk about the importance of cultivating _esprit de corps._ This is like if a guide to interior decoration contained guidelines on how to move furniture into your apartment but nothing about aesthetics.
